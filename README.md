### Tuts+ Tutorial: Beyond the Basics With Framer

#### Instructor: Hathibelagal Ashraff

In my [previous tutorial](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-prototypes-for-ios-and-android-with-framer-basics--cms-24270) about Framer, I talked about the framework's basic concepts and showed you how to use them to create simple mock-ups. In this tutorial, I am going to focus on a few more advanced features of the framework that allow you to add more complex interactions and effects to your mock-ups.
